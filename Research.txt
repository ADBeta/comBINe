File type notes:
.cue
	Plaintext file containing track information
	MODEx/sect size(?)
	Cue Files have tracks and indexes, when combines, the tracks are indexed.
	
	
	
	
.bin
	
	
	
What does cdMage do?
	Changes cue file to have no files, just indexes. 
	Somehow keeps track of tine (?) in the cue as the bins get merged.


	It seems that the .bin files just get appended ontop of eachother. Mimic this 
	behaviour and cmp my binary with cdMage binary.

	Tested via cat and this is correct. They are just appended.

	Pull filenames in order from the cue file


My code plan
	First, read bin files until they end, and push the bytes to output file.
	Append to output file as going. If this prooves to be too slow, pull into
	a buffer RAM chunk, before pushing out.
