# psx-comBINe
<b> (c) ADBeta 2023 </b>  

psx-comBINe is a program to combine/merge multiple .bin files from a psx .cue  
.bin CD-ROM dump, into a single .cue and .bin file.  

This function is commonly done via CDMage, or other tools in the PSX community,  
but having a purpose built tools seems like a useful addition to the community  
I love so much.  

This project is just a hobby, and is designed for Linux to begin with. I will  
eventually port it to a Windows exe, feel free to do this with the files if you  
want to test it out.
